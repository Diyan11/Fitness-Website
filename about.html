    <h2>About Your Coach</h2>
    <img src="trainer-about.jpg" alt="Professional Fitness Coach" class="about-photo" />
    <p>
      I'm a certified personal trainer with over 8 years of experience helping clients transform their health, body, and mindset. My passion lies in creating personalized fitness journeys that deliver real, sustainable results.
    </p>
    <p>
      My coaching philosophy combines evidence-based training methods with nutritional science and psychological support. I believe that true transformation happens when we address not just the physical aspects of fitness, but also the mental and emotional components that drive lasting change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you're looking to lose weight, build muscle, improve athletic performance, or simply feel more confident in your own skin, I'm here to guide you every step of the way. My clients consistently achieve their goals because I provide the accountability, expertise, and motivation they need to succeed.
